}
```

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.stateofthedapps.com/stats`

### Response

The above request returns JSON structured like this:

* `dappCount` the total number of DApps on State of the DApps.
* `dappContractCount` the total number of DApps contracts on State of the DApps.

## Known issues / Limitations
* DApp growth figures arenâ€™t exposed yet via this API, but this is expected to be added Soon. Bug us for raising the priority of this.
* Category transaction statistics are only counted for Ethereum and lack USD equivalent values.
* USD values are calculated with the last known exchange rate.
